You’ve been working on a project for days; everything is running smoothly on your machine, you setup docker, but when it’s time to deploy, nothing works.

## The "It Works on My Machine" Problem"

This is a common problem in software development, and it usually happens because of the differences between the development and production environments. The development environment is usually a local machine, and the production environment is a remote server.

## Version Management Challenges

## Introducing Nix

## Where Docker Fits In

# What is Nix?

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is a tool that takes a unique approach to package management and system configuration. Learn how to make reproducible, declarative and reliable systems.

> Nix has its own language called Nix, a straightforward functional language. While I won't delve further into the language itself, here are the resources you can check out on how to start on writing Nix.

## Key Benefits

### Reproducible

Nix ensures that your system is reproducible by providing a unique approach to package management and system configuration. So you can be sure that your system will work the same way on every machine.

### Declarative

Nix allows you to declare your system configuration in a simple and concise way. You can define your system configuration in a single file, and Nix will take care of the rest.

### Reliable

Nix is a reliable tool that ensures that your system is always in a consistent state. It provides a unique approach to package management and system configuration, so you can be sure that your system will always work as expected.

# Now, Nix Flakes

## What are Nix Flakes?

[Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) is an experimental feature of Nix that provides a more convenient way to manage Nix projects. It allows you to define your project as a single file (`flake.nix`), and Nix will take care of the rest.
